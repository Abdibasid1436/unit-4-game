    <h1>Crystals Collector-Game</h1>

    <h2>Crystal Game Rules</h2>
    <p>The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
        When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.
        The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
        The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
    </p>
    <p>The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it. Each time when the game starts, the game will change the values of each crystal.</p>
